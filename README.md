# Latest Trailers

## What is this?
I wanted to build something that is as close to the experience of watching movie trailers before a movie starts. Just like in the cinemas, you don't even know what the movie is called until the title is revealed at the end!

Your browser keeps track of which trailers you've seen, so if you come back another time, rest assured you'll see something new!
